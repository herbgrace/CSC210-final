                        <p>This quote resonates with me because it reminds me that anything can be changed if I try hard enough.
                            Using my current situation as an excuse is exactly that, an excuse. 
                            I need to have the willpower and dedication to make change if I want anything to happen.

                            <p>After graduating from Neumont, I want to work as a software engineer. This career should
                                supply me with everything I need to live comfortably and happily.
                                I want to continue with my hobbies related to computers/electronics and mechanics. 
                                I would like to learn more about designing computer parts, and possibly make my own computers for fun.
                                The way I see it, a job is not the final goal, it's merely a stepping stone in the path to fulfillment.
